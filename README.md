Program 1 - Array Manipulation - Use try with multi catch
Tom wants to store the price details of the products that he purchased from the departmental store.  Help him do this by using the concept of Arrays.

To do this create a public class ArrayException with a method getPriceDetails as :
public String getPriceDetails() -  This method should do the following
Get the size of an array as input and then get the elements of the array(all elements are int) as input.
Next, user should provide the index of the array. This method should return the element at that index as â€œThe array element is â€œ+<that value>
This program may generate ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException / InputMismatchException
In case of ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, the function should return â€œArray index is out of rangeâ€.
When providing the input, if the input is not an integer, it will generate InputMismatchException.  In this case the function should return â€œInput was not in the correct formatâ€.
Use exception handling mechanism to handle the exception. Use separate catch block for handling each exception. In the catch block, return the appropriate message.
Write a main method and test the above function.
